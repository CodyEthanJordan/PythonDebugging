Using pdb
---------

pdb is the command line pythong debugger which is also integrated as part of Spyder
You can read the official documentation here:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html
I also found these resources especially helpful:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4228637/getting-started-with-the-python-debugger-pdb

To start pdb in spyder
* Press the blue arrow on the toolbar which says Debug file (Ctrl + F5) *

This will land you in a (pdb) interactive console in your current python environment

Common commands
w - show (w)here I am in a stack trace
l - (l)ist nearby code
n - go to the (n)ext line
s - (s)tep to the next command, including entering functions
c - (c)ontinue to the next breakpoint or end of program
r - keep executing until the (r)eturn statement of the function you are in
p - (p)rint the value of whatever variable you put after it, such as "p variable1"
