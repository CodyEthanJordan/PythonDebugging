Debugging and Git Demo
----------------------

Taken from:
https://github.com/CodyEthanJordan/PythonDebugging

Made for Introduction to Numerical Computing by Cody Jordan

GitCommands.sh has notes and instructions on how to use git
GitExample/ is a directory with my version of homework 7 which I use as an example of how to use git
DebuggingExamples/ has a few programs which show off features of debugging and exception handling

There is a cheat sheet for how to use pdb in DebuggingExamples/UsingPDB.txt
